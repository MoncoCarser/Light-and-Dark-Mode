# Light-and-Dark-Mode
Exercise project to learn about changing web page between dark and light mode.

I do find it still a bit confusing to understand, as there are multiple steps to include for a smooth colour change.
By having background in two colours, images in two colours, and rest following pre-set colour colour codes for either situation, with a bit of JavaScript and a lot of CSS the web page can change from light to dark.

Also local storage is used to remember if user had chosen dark mode.
